The example file needs three libraries to run.  The first two, lwjgl.jar and mote4.jar, are in the lib/ directory.  The third dependency is Google Guava, which I installed as a global library via Maven in IntelliJ.

If you're on macOS, you'll need to add the VM argument '-XstartOnFirstThread' to run.
